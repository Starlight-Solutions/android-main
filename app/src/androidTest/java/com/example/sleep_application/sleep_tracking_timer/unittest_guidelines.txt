Unit test standard and guidelines

1. Source Code Separation
   - Keep test classes separate from the main source code.
	For logic related test, place them in the "app\src\test\java\com\example\sleep_application" (test) directory.
	For UI interaction behaviour test, place them in the "app\src\androidTest\java\com\example\sleep_application" (androidTest) directory.
   - This separation ensures that test code doesn't accidentally run in the production environment.

2. Package Naming Convention:
   - Match the package of the test class with the package of the source class.

3. Test Case Naming:
   - Choose descriptive and meaningful test names.
   - A test name should convey the action being tested and the expected outcome.
   - Avoid vague names, be detail with expected result.

4. Test Behavior and Expectations:
   - Focus on testing the behavior of individual units of code.
   - Verify whether the expected output of a method matches the actual one.
   - Check if function calls made inside the method occur the desired number of times.
   - Avoid testing code that is not part of the method under test.

2. Select Generate -> Test.
3. Make sure the generated test file is in the correct folder.
4. Import correct Unit test library, refer to SleepTrackingFragmentTest.java file.
5. Setup fragment for testing, write logic for testing.
